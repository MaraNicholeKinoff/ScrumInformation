## The Scrum Framework
![Scrum Framework](/images/ScrumFramework.png)

## Getting Stated
1. Create the product vision and backlog as a team. A scrum project is designed to work based on a team effort. Work together or the project will not work.
2. As a team, estimate how much time needs to be allotted for each item in the product backlog. Remember to be realistic in how much time and effort you believe each item will take. Determine what will be realistic compared to what would be ideal.
3. As a team, determine if and where there are dependencies between items in the product backlog. It might be helpful for the development team to discuss technical dependencies with the technical lead while the scrum master discuss functional dependencies.
4. In your team’s first sprint, try not to overwhelm yourselves. Starting small and working your way up to your goals may be the best practice for your team. That being said, the team also might do better with starting strong and doing as much as possible as soon as possible. This is also the time to discuss your team's strategy regarding a burn-down chart.
5. At this point, it might be best to seek advice from the technical lead, the process lead, and/or Dr. Babb. Having an outside perspective can help ensure that your team is on the right track.

*Remember, you can not be afraid to ask questions for the duration of this project. If you start finding yourself falling behind or getting stuck, let your team know immediately. The faster you ask for help, the faster you and your team can find a solution.*

## Scrum Glossary
**Burn-down Chart:** a chart which shows the amount of work which is thought to remain in a backlog. Time is shown on the horizontal axis and work remaining on the vertical axis. As time progresses and items are drawn from the backlog and completed, a plot line showing work remaining may be expected to fall. The amount of work may be assessed in any of several ways such as user story points or task hours. Work remaining in Sprint Backlogs and Product Backlogs may be communicated by means of a burn-down chart. See also: Burnup Chart

**Burn-up Chart:** a chart which shows the amount of work which has been completed. Time is shown on the horizontal axis and work completed on the vertical axis. As time progresses and items are drawn from the backlog and completed, a plot line showing the work done may be expected to rise. The amount of work may be assessed in any of several ways such as user story points or task hours. The amount of work considered to be in-scope may also be plotted as a line; the burn-up can be expected to approach this line as work is completed.

**Coherent/Coherence:** The quality of the relationship between certain Product Backlog items which may make them worthy of consideration as a whole. See also: Sprint Goal

**Daily Scrum:** daily time-boxed event of 15 minutes for the Development Team to re-plan the next day of development work during a Sprint. Updates are reflected in the Sprint Backlog.

**Definition of Done:** a shared understanding of expectations that the Increment must live up to in order to be releasable into production. Managed by the Development Team.

**Development Team:** the role(s) within a Scrum Team accountable for managing, organizing and doing all development work required to create a releasable Increment of product every Sprint.

**Emergence:** the process of the coming into existence or prominence of new facts or new knowledge of a fact, or knowledge of a fact becoming visible unexpectedly.

**Empiricism:** process control type in which only the past is accepted as certain and in which decisions are based on observation, experience and experimentation. Empiricism has three pillars: transparency, inspection and adaptation.

**Engineering standards:** a shared set of development and technology standards that a Development Team applies to create releasable Increments of software.

**Forecast (of functionality):** the selection of items from the Product Backlog a Development Team deems feasible for implementation in a Sprint.

**Increment:** a piece of working software that adds to previously created Increments, where the sum of all Increments -as a whole - form a product.

**Product Backlog:** an ordered list of the work to be done in order to create, maintain and sustain a product. Managed by the Product Owner.

**Product Backlog Refinement:** the activity in a Sprint through which the Product Owner and the Development Teams add granularity to the Product Backlog.

**Product Owner:** the role in Scrum accountable for maximizing the value of a product, primarily by incrementally managing and expressing business and functional expectations for a product to the Development Team(s).

**Ready:** a shared understanding by the Product Owner and the Development Team regarding the preferred level of description of Product Backlog items introduced at Sprint Planning.

**Refinement:** see Product Backlog Refinement

**Scrum:** a framework to support teams in complex product development. Scrum consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and rules, as defined in the Scrum Guide.

**Scrum Board:** a physical board to visualize information for and by the Scrum Team, often used to manage Sprint Backlog. Scrum boards are an optional implementation within Scrum to make information visible.

**Scrum Master:** the role within a Scrum Team accountable for guiding, coaching, teaching and assisting a Scrum Team and its environments in a proper understanding and use of Scrum.

**Scrum Team:** a self-organizing team consisting of a Product Owner, Development Team and Scrum Master.

**Scrum Values:** a set of fundamental values and qualities underpinning the Scrum framework; commitment, focus, openness, respect and courage.

**Self-organization:** the management principle that teams autonomously organize their work. Self-organization happens within boundaries and against given goals. Teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team.

**Sprint:** time-boxed event of 30 days, or less, that serves as a container for the other Scrum events and activities. Sprints are done consecutively, without intermediate gaps.

**Sprint Backlog:** an overview of the development work to realize a Sprint’s goal, typically a forecast of functionality and the work needed to deliver that functionality. Managed by the Development Team.

**Sprint Goal:** a short expression of the purpose of a Sprint, often a business problem that is addressed. Functionality might be adjusted during the Sprint in order to achieve the Sprint Goal.

**Sprint Planning:** time-boxed event of 8 hours, or less, to start a Sprint. It serves for the Scrum Team to inspect the work from the Product Backlog that’s most valuable to be done next and design that work into Sprint backlog.

**Sprint Retrospective:** time-boxed event of 3 hours, or less, to end a Sprint. It serves for the Scrum Team to inspect the past Sprint and plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.

**Sprint Review:** time-boxed event of 4 hours, or less, to conclude the development work of a Sprint. It serves for the Scrum Team and the stakeholders to inspect the Increment of product resulting from the Sprint, assess the impact of the work performed on overall progress and update the Product backlog in order to maximize the value of the next period.

**Stakeholder:** a person external to the Scrum Team with a specific interest in and knowledge of a product that is required for incremental discovery. Represented by the Product Owner and actively engaged with the Scrum Team at Sprint Review.

**Technical Debt:** the typically unpredictable overhead of maintaining the product, often caused by less than ideal design decisions, contributing to the total cost of ownership. May exist unintentionally in the Increment or introduced purposefully to realize value earlier.

**Values:** When the values of commitment, courage, focus, openness and respect are embodied and lived by the Scrum Team, the *Scrum pillars* of transparency, inspection, and adaptation *come to life* and *build trust* for everyone. The Scrum Team members learn and explore those values as they work with the Scrum events, roles and artifacts. 

**Velocity:** an optional, but often used, indication of the average amount of Product Backlog turned into an Increment of product during a Sprint by a Scrum Team, tracked by the Development Team for use within the Scrum Team.

# Sprint Planning Guide

1. As a team, discuss what objective the sprint will achieve. This will be the sprint goal and should reflect on what the development team is building for the next increment.
2. The development team will determine what product backlog items to move into the sprint based on their capabilities, past performance, and upcoming obstacles.
    * Is there an item from the past sprint log that did not get done that needs to become a higher priority?
    * Are there any events, such as holidays, coming up that the team needs to plan around?
3. For each item in the sprint backlog, the team will need to create a definition of done.
    * How will the team know when an item from the backlog is functional?
    * Is the definition of done for this item agreed upon by the team?
4. The development team will need to self organize so that they can explain to the scrum master how they intend to complete the work for to accomplish the sprint goal. 
    * Who will be working on what parts of each item in the sprint backlog?
    * What is the justification for each team member working on a specific task?
5. Participate in Planning Poker as a team to determine the effort that items in the sprint backlog will take.

# Planning Poker Guide
Planning poker is method for estimating how much effort each item in the product backlog will require. The main concepts in planning poker is consensus based decisions, intense discussions, relative sizing, accurate groups, and leveraging what you know about past estimations. 

For each item in the backlog, the team will need to estimate how much effort will be required to complete the item. This estimation is done through cards that represent the estimated effort.
    * ½ - Used to size tiny items.
    * 1, 2, 3 - Used to size small items.
    * 5, 8, 13 - Used to size medium items. Typically, an item that is sized at 13 is the largest item that would be scheduled in a sprint. 
    * 20, 40 - Used to size large items. These are are typically features.
    * 100 - Used to size very large items, these items are typically called an epic.
    * ? - Used when a team member doesn’t understand the item and needs additional clarification or they do not know how to properly estimate the item. 

Planning Poker Rules
1. The product owner selects an item from the product backlog and presents it to the team. 
2. The development team discusses the item and asks for any clarification.
3. Each team member privately selects a “card” that represents what they estimate the effort required will be. 
4. Once all estimates are in, all estimates are revealed.
5. If  the “cards” are all the same, then there is a consensus. That estimate because the official estimate for the item.
6. If the “cards” are not the same, then there is a discussion to determine assumptions and misunderstandings. After the discussion, return to step 3 and repeat until there is a consensus.

# Daily Scrum Guide

The Daily Scrum meeting is a roughly 15 minute meeting that the teams holds to plan work until the next Daily Scrum meeting. At a minimum, each team needs to hold three Daily Scrum meetings per week. These meetings will need to be documented in a way that the Process Lead and Technical Lead can have access to what was discussed in each meeting.

There are three questions that need to be discussed by each team member at each Daily Scrum meeting. 

1. What did you work on since the last Daily Scrum Meeting to meet the Sprint Goal?
2. What are you currently working on to meet the Sprint Goal?
3. What might prevent you from meeting the Sprint Goal? 

This is a meeting that should improve communication regarding the Sprint Goal. The Daily Scrum will also help with transparency and accountability.

    * Did the team effectively communicate during the sprint?
    * Were team members present during daily scrum meetings?
    * What were the impediments in the sprint?
    * What solutions were found for these impediments?
2. Discuss what patterns and behavior should be continued to foster and environment for success as well as what needs improvement.
    * Is there something the team needs to do better for the next sprint?
    * What is the team doing right that needs to be continued?
    * Based on how the last sprint went, what would help the team perform better, regardless of how well it went?
3. Come up with a plan for improving the team based on the current conversation in preparation for the next sprint. Consult with the leads and Dr. Babb if needed.
